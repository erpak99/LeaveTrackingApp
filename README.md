   LEAVE TRACKING SYSTEM FOR A COMPANY 
* There are two types of users in our system, employee and supervisor.
* Both types of users register to the system by entering their first name, last name, email, password and phone number.
* It is not possible to register in the system with a previously used e-mail address.
* Passwords are displayed encoded in the database for security.
* In our system, each supervisor has employee lists and each employee has leave requests lists.
* Employees create leave requests by entering the start date, end date, leave duration, leave description.
* When the permission request is sent, the permission status shows as "PENDING".
* Each employee can view the leave requests they have created.
* Each supervisor can view the leave requests created by their employees.
* Supervisors can update the leave status as "APPROVE" or "REJECT".
* All leave requests can be viewed by leave status (pending, approved, rejected leaves).
* All leave requests can be viewed by leave description (annual, wedding, hospital).
* Leaves of each employee can be viewed according to their leave status and leave description.
* Leaves of employees under the supervisor can also be viewed by leave status and leave description.
* Leaves between two specific dates can be viewed.
* Leaves after a certain date can be viewed.
* Leaves before the specific date which belong to specific supervisor can be viewed. 
* List of leaves taken more than a certain day by employee id can be viewed.(e.g. leaves that employee id number 2 has taken for more than 3 days.)
* List of leaves for a user before a certain date by status can be viewed.(e.g. approved/rejected leaves received by employee id number 1 before 01.01.2022)
